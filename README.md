Description

In this project i was able to choose between different companies and making a website for the company of my choosing.
I chose a company that is selling jackets. The website showcases these jackets and the customer is able to purchase them
through the website.
The target audience is basically young adults - adults, that are into being outdoors and exploring the world.

The website was build using html, css and javascript. 
The website gets its content from a headless webhost running wordpress. The website makes  REST API calls to the headless 
webhost.

The website is currently running on netlify.
